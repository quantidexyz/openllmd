/**
 * CLI (`openllm`) converger — the daemon keeps the INSTALLED CLI binary on
 * the cloud's pinned release, on the same auto-update tick and under the same
 * opt-out toggle as its own self-update (`self-update.ts`). One flow, one
 * toggle: disabling daemon auto-update pins the CLI too.
 *
 * Same converge-to-published policy (update on ANY mismatch, so republishing
 * an older tag rolls CLIs back) and the same trust gates (SHA-256 of the
 * decompressed bytes against the published digest; atomic same-dir temp +
 * rename swap; darwin dequarantine + ad-hoc sign). Differences from the
 * daemon's own updater:
 *
 *   - No drain / no restart — the CLI is not this process; the swap is just a
 *     file replace. A running `openllm` keeps its old inode (POSIX rename).
 *   - The daemon NEVER installs the CLI — an absent binary at
 *     `~/.openllm/bin/openllm` (or the legacy `openllmc` path) is a skip, mirroring the vendor-CLI policy in
 *     `cli-install.ts`. Manual `openllm self-update` also still works; both
 *     paths write verified bytes via distinct pid-suffixed temps, so a race is
 *     last-writer-wins with a complete binary either way.
 *   - Its own attempt SLOT (`cli`) in the shared `state.json` so a daemon
 *     attempt never masks a CLI attempt (or vice versa).
