/**
 * Per-provider AUTH CONFIG — a `config.json` sidecar next to the isolated CLI
 * (`<cliRoot>/config.json`) that caches:
 *
 *   - `upstream_url` — the genuine inference endpoint the vendor CLI POSTs to,
 *     CAPTURED from a real headless `exec` request (it drifts on CLI updates —
 *     e.g. codex's `/backend-api/codex/responses` host moved — and can't be
 *     hardcoded). The capture KILLS the CLI before anything reaches the vendor
 *     (zero token cost, works offline).
 *   - `cli_version` — CLI meta, the capture freshness key.
 *
 * Token REFRESH is NOT done here — each delegate triggers its CLI's OWN native
 * refresh (see `delegation/refresh.ts`), so no OAuth `client_id`/`token_url` is
 * extracted or stored.
 *
 * Bright line (terms-compliance), amended for `claude_code` by
 * `docs/proposals/active-sub-method.md` §claude_code handrolled parity: for
 * every provider EXCEPT `claude_code`, nothing here is replayed as inference
 * identity — the daemon serves each request with the ORIGINATOR's own headers
 * (`@openllmsh/wire/lib/forwarded-headers`) + the injected bearer, and this
 * config supplies only the request TARGET URL. For `claude_code` the config
 * ALSO persists the isolated CLI's own IDENTITY HEADERS (`identity_headers`,
 * captured from the CLI's real request shape — killed before it reaches the
 * vendor, zero token cost) so the HANDROLLED transport presents the same
 * identity the BRIDGE (the genuine CLI) presents — a sub-method toggle must
 * never change which requests the vendor accepts. The daemon still genuinely
 * holds that CLI + its subscription credential, so this replays the daemon's
 * OWN identity, never a forged third-party one. The volatile/secret
 * `authorization` header is never captured or stored.
 *
 * Plain JSON (read via `readJsonFile`, written via `Bun.write` + `JSON.stringify`)
 * — always fresh on re-read after a re-capture, no runtime transpiler, works
 * identically in the compiled `--bytecode` binary.
 *
 * Supersedes the former `exec-fixture.ts` (URL+identity capture) — see
 * `docs/proposals/delegation-exec-fixtures.md` (amended) and
 * `docs/proposals/subscription-oauth-terms-compliance.md`.
